ffsqueue - Fast Fixed Size Queue
================================

Fast and clean implementation of a fixed size queue in JavaScript. 

It avoids the use of `push()` and `unshift()` methods of `Array` object and should therefore not cause 
any object (re)allocations.

Is it really faster than a regular Array?
