ffsqueue - Fast Fixed Size Queue
================================

Fast and clean implementation of a fixed size queue in JavaScript. 

Is it really fast?
-----------------------------------------

Check it with a sample use case here: <http://jsperf.com/ffsqueue>

Currently, it is faster in Chromium 22.0 and Opera 12.02 but not in Firefox 16.
